# Interactive Cooking Website

## Overview

This is an interactive cooking website built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The project focuses on frontend interactivity, theme switching, and handling user input dynamically.

Users can explore cooking content, switch between two visual themes, and interact with a feature that collects cuisine preferences and email input.

## How It Works

- JavaScript handles theme switching dynamically.
- When users click the "Learn How to Cook" button, they are prompted to enter:
  - The cuisine they want to learn
  - Their email address
- A confirmation message is displayed dynamically using DOM manipulation.

_Note: This is a frontend-only project. The email functionality does not send real emails and no backend is connected._
